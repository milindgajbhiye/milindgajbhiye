# 👋 Hey, I’m Milind Gajbhiye  

### 🚀 About Me  
- 💻 Aspiring **Software Developer**, currently in an intense battle with **DSA in Java** (Java: 99 - Me: 1).  
- 📱 Building a **Voice Messaging App** using **only Python** because I love making things unnecessarily difficult.  
- 🤖 Working on an **AI-powered code debugger**—basically trying to get AI to do my debugging so I can suffer less.  
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Learning graphs** from scratch. So far, all I see are **nodes, edges, and my confusion.**  
- 🛠️ Setting up **IntelliJ, Java, and Spring Boot**, but they seem to be setting me up for frustration instead.  

### 🎯 Current Struggles  
- **Git & GitHub?** Yeah… I’m still at the “copy-paste random git commands” stage.  
- **React & Flask?** I heard they’re cool. I also heard they require understanding.  
- **Hackathon on Mobile Internet Safety?** Step 1: Figure out what I’m even doing.  

### 💡 Things I’m (Somewhat) Proud Of  
- Decided to **clone ChatGPT**—because why not compete with a billion-dollar AI?  
- Chose **Java for DSA** instead of Python. Clearly, I love suffering.  
- **Still alive** after dealing with all the errors, bugs, and failed deployments.  

### 💞️ Looking to Collaborate On  
- Anything exciting, **as long as it doesn’t break my brain (too much).**  

### 📫 How to Reach Me  
- Just whisper "segmentation fault" three times, and I’ll appear.  

### ⚡ Fun Fact  
- My debugging technique? **Add print statements everywhere and hope for the best.**
