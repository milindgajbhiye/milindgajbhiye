# 👋 Hey, I’m Milind Gajbhiye  

### 🚀 About Me  
- 💻 Aspiring **Software Developer** still fighting an epic boss battle with **DSA in Java** (Java: 999 - Me: 1). ![Java](https://img.icons8.com/color/25/java-coffee-cup-logo--v1.png)  
- 📊 Built a **Student Management System** in Java — it manages students better than I manage my own time.  ![Java](https://img.icons8.com/color/25/java-coffee-cup-logo--v1.png)  
- 🎭 Developed a **Face Emotion Detection App** in Python — now even my code knows when I’m confused. ![AI](https://img.icons8.com/fluency/25/artificial-intelligence.png) ![Python](https://img.icons8.com/color/25/python.png)  
- 📚 Created **My Python StudyBuddy**, because even Python needs a buddy to survive my learning curve.  ![Python](https://img.icons8.com/color/25/python.png)
- 🌍 Experimented with a **Tourism Web Project** — because traveling virtually is cheaper than buying tickets. 🌐  
- 🗡️ Tried 3D modeling with my **3D Sword Project** — spoiler: Blender almost defeated me. ![Blender](https://img.icons8.com/color/25/blender-3d.png) 
- 📸 Made an **Instagram Clone** in HTML — currently has 0 users, but hey, Zuckerberg also started somewhere.  🌐
- ⚙️ Constantly tweaking my **GitHub config**, hoping one day I’ll actually understand Git instead of just copy-pasting commands. ![GitHub](https://img.icons8.com/glyph-neue/25/github.png)

### 🎯 Current Struggles  
- **Git & GitHub?** Still in the “help, I messed up my repo again” phase. ![GitHub](https://img.icons8.com/glyph-neue/25/github.png)  
- **React & Flask?** Sitting in my “to-learn” list, right next to “how to cook without burning stuff.” ⚛️  
- **DSA in Java?** Let’s just say my arrays and I are not on speaking terms.  
- **Hackathons?** My main skill is panicking creatively. 🚀

### 💡 Things I’m (Somewhat) Proud Of  
- Decided to **clone ChatGPT**—because why not compete with a billion-dollar AI?  
- Chose **Java for DSA** instead of Python. Clearly, I love suffering.  
- **Still alive** after dealing with all the errors, bugs, and failed deployments.  

### 💞️ Looking to Collaborate On  
- Anything exciting, **as long as it doesn’t break my brain (too much).**
