# 👋 Hey, I’m Milind Gajbhiye  

### 🚀 About Me  
- 💻 Aspiring **Software Developer** who’s still fighting an epic boss battle with **DSA in Java** (Java: 999 - Me: 1).  
- 📊 Recently made a **Student Management System** in Java — it manages students better than I manage my own time.  
- 🎭 Built a **Face Emotion Detection App** in Python — now even my code knows when I’m confused.  
- 📚 Created **My Python StudyBuddy**, because even Python needs a buddy to survive my learning curve.  
- 🌍 Experimented with a **Tourism Web Project** — because traveling virtually is cheaper than buying tickets.  
- 🗡️ Tried 3D modeling with my **3D Sword Project** — spoiler: Blender almost defeated me.  
- 📸 Made an **Instagram Clone** in HTML — currently has 0 users, but hey, Zuckerberg also started somewhere.  
- ⚙️ Constantly tweaking my **GitHub config**, hoping one day I’ll actually understand Git instead of just copy-pasting commands.

### 🎯 Current Struggles  
- **Git & GitHub?** Still in the “help, I messed up my repo again” phase.  
- **React & Flask?** Sitting in my “to-learn” list, right next to “how to cook without burning stuff.”  
- **DSA in Java?** Let’s just say my arrays and I are not on speaking terms.  
- **Hackathons?** My main skill is panicking creatively.

### 💡 Things I’m (Somewhat) Proud Of  
- Decided to **clone ChatGPT**—because why not compete with a billion-dollar AI?  
- Chose **Java for DSA** instead of Python. Clearly, I love suffering.  
- **Still alive** after dealing with all the errors, bugs, and failed deployments.  

### 💞️ Looking to Collaborate On
