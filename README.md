# 👋 Hey there, I’m Milind Gajbhiye  

### 🚀 About Me  
- 💻 Trying to become an SDE (but DSA keeps attacking me 😭)  
- 📱 Decided to build a voice messaging app with **Android Studio with Kotlin** (because why make life easy?)  
- 🤖 Also attempting to make an **AI-powered code debugger**—basically teaching AI to fix my own bugs.  
- 🕵️‍♂️ Just started **learning graphs**… currently lost in the edges and vertices.  
- 🔧 Setting up IntelliJ, Java, and Spring Boot… but they refuse to set up my patience.  

### 🎯 Current Struggles  
- **Git & GitHub** → I just copy-paste `git commands` and pray.  
- **React & Flask** → They sound fancy, but right now, they’re just a mystery.  
- **Mobile Internet Safety Hackathon** → Hoping to win, but first, gotta figure out what I’m doing.  

### 💡 Things I’m Proud Of  
- Decided to make **a ChatGPT clone** (as if one AI wasn’t enough).  
- Attempting **DSA in Java** despite Java trying its best to scare me away.  
- Somehow still motivated after all these challenges.  

### 💞️ Looking to Collaborate On  
- Anything that won’t break my brain (but I’ll probably pick the hardest thing anyway).  

### 📫 How to Reach Me  
- Just scream "Milind!" into the void—if it echoes back, I’m probably debugging.  

### ⚡ Fun Fact  
- My projects have more errors than actual code, but that’s what makes them fun!
